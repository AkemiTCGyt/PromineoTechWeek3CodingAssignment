# PromineoTechWeek3CodingAssignment

# Coded by Thomas Le

## Synopsis
This assignment tests my knowledge of basic for loops, the array data structure, and basic methods using arithmetic. I also created my own method call
beatInflation which returns a boolean and takes in three doubles as parameters. Respectively these parameters are currentWage, newWage, and inflation.
IThis method will check whether or not the user's current wage is greater than their previous year's wage plus inflation. If yes, then that's a good
thing and the method returns true. Else, it returns false.
